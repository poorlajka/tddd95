/*
    Simple implementation of the Disjoint-set data structure (aka Union-find) 
    which stores a collection of disjoint sets containing in this case integers.
    The Disjoint-set has two main operations: 
        1. unify(a, b) - merge the subset containing a and the subset containing b into one
        2. find(a) - find the root of the set which contains a 
    Both run in O(log(n)) (space complexity of O(n)) without path compression and rank
    With rank and path compression they run with amortized constant time complexity.
